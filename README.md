How to compile my code 
by:Arianne Van Solt




Run the makefile with the command 'make'


Once the program compiles, run the a.out file.


Once the program is runnig it will prompt the user to input a test file.


This file must have three columns <char, char, int>. This will tell the program 
what node is associated to another and the edge's weight of the nodes. 


Once the user submits a test file that is in the directory it will prompt
the user to submit a source node. Depending on the test file it will do the Dijkstra
for a directed or undirected graph. 

After it prints out the results, the program will prompt the user for a the maximum amount of edges 
that can be used for the shortest path and the source node.

It will then print out the result and the program will finish.

-----------------NOTE--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If the node can not be be reached,the program will print "Unreachable" next to the corresponding node
